    "Tuples are a data structure in many programming languages, including Python, that have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ordered: Tuples are ordered collections of elements, which means that the elements have a specific position or index within the tuple, and this order is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Heterogeneous: Tuples can hold elements of different data types. For example, a tuple can contain a combination of integers, strings, floats, or other data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Immutable: Tuples are immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, you cannot change its elements, add new elements, or remove elements from it. However, you can create a new tuple by combining or modifying existing tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Enclosed in Parentheses: In many programming languages, including Python, tuples are typically defined by enclosing their elements in parentheses, like this: `(1, \"apple\", 3.14)`. However, in some languages, parentheses are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Accessed by Index: You can access individual elements of a tuple by their index, starting from 0. For example, in Python, you can access the first element of a tuple `my_tuple` like this: `my_tuple[0]`."

    "In Python, tuples have two built-in methods: `count()` and `index()`. These methods allow you to perform specific operations on tuples. Here are examples of each method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `count()`: This method is used to count the number of occurrences of a specified value within the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)\n",

    "In this example, `count_of_twos` will be 3 because the value 2 appears three times in the tuple `my_tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `index()`: This method is used to find the index (position) of the first occurrence of a specified value within the tuple.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\n",

    "In this example, `index_of_30` will be 2 because the value 30 is found at index 2 in the tuple `my_tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why tuples have only these two built-in methods compared to lists is because of the fundamental difference between the two data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Immutability: Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed once the tuple is created. This immutability makes it unnecessary to have methods for adding, removing, or modifying elements, which are common operations for lists. Therefore, the design of tuple methods is focused on operations that do not modify the tuple itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simplicity: Tuples are intended to be simple and lightweight data structures for storing collections of values. Lists, on the other hand, are more complex and versatile, supporting a wide range of operations and methods due to their mutability. This complexity in lists is reflected in the larger number of built-in methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are designed to be simple, immutable, and focused on retrieval and counting operations, while lists offer greater flexibility and mutability, which is why lists have a larger number of built-in methods."
