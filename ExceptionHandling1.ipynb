    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program. When an exceptional event occurs, an exception object is created to represent the error, and the program's control is transferred to an appropriate exception-handling code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be raised for various reasons, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Runtime Errors:** These are errors that occur while the program is running, such as division by zero, attempting to access an index that is out of bounds, or trying to open a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logical Errors:** These are errors in the program's logic, and they may not always result in exceptions. Instead, they can lead to incorrect or unexpected results in the program's output. These are not exceptions in the technical sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's discuss the difference between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exceptions:**\n",
    "- Exceptions occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "- They are runtime errors that disrupt the normal flow of the program.\n",
    "- They are handled using `try...except` blocks to gracefully recover from errors or report them.\n",
    "- Examples of exceptions include `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `IndexError`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax Errors:**\n",
    "- Syntax errors occur before the program is executed.\n",
    "- They are errors in the program's code structure or syntax.\n",
    "- These errors prevent the program from running at all and must be fixed in the code.\n",
    "- Examples of syntax errors include missing colons, invalid indentation, misspelled variable names, and incorrect keyword usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a syntax error and an exception in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax Error Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This code contains a syntax error\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a missing closing parenthesis at the end of the `print` statement results in a syntax error, preventing the program from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This code generates a runtime exception\n",
    "x = 5 / 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, attempting to divide by zero results in a `ZeroDivisionError` exception. The program can still run, but it will terminate if the exception is not handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are runtime errors that can be handled, while syntax errors are code-level errors that prevent the program from running and must be corrected in the code before execution."

When the `make_transaction` function is called, it raises this custom exception if the withdrawal amount exceeds the account balance. This allows us to catch and handle this specific error condition with a custom error message and access to relevant attributes like the current balance and withdrawal amount. If the withdrawal is successful, we print the new balance, and if there's an error, we print the custom error message."
